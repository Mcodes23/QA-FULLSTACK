Challenge Questions:
1. Password Authentication:
○ Why is it important to store passwords in a hashed format? What security
advantage does this provide over plain text passwords?
ans: Storing passwords in a hashed format is critical for protecting user data, maintaining privacy, and preventing unauthorized access, even in the event of a data breach. It’s a fundamental security best practice for any application that handles sensitive information.
2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
○ How does implementing MFA enhance the security of the transaction process?
What types of attacks does it help prevent?
3. Balance Verification:
○ Why is it necessary to check the account balance before allowing a withdrawal?
What risks are involved if this step is skipped?
4. Daily Transaction Limit:
○ What purpose does the daily transaction limit serve? How does it help in
preventing fraudulent or excessive withdrawals?
5. Improvement:
○ If you were to add extra features, such as fraud detection (e.g., detecting
abnormal withdrawal patterns), how would you go about doing this? What
additional data would you track to detect fraud?
